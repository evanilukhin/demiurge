  "description": "Almost four years of production experience, very love to write (and especially read) human readable code and work with microservices. I'm interested and have practice in the application integration using different approaches (Talend ESB, Apache Kafka, SQL, Apache Camel). Aside from software engineering, my passion is social psychology, especially decision-making problems. I have a keen interest in how to reduce the influence of miscommunication and misunderstanding in daily interactions between people.",
